            FileDirector comes in 3 versions, Cloud, SBE and Enterprise. FileDirector software is largely the same, following a modular approach meaning that we can build a custom document management solution for you. This way, you only pay for what you need.

            One of the major benefits that FileDirector offers is the opportunity of growth. No matter how big or small the organization is, FileDirector can adapt to meet demand. FileDirector encourages scalability externally as well as internally, allowing the growth of an organizationâ€™s document management solution to be comprehensively universal.
