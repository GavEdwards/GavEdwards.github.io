    <h4>Electronic Documents:</h4>
    <p> Why not store all your electronic documents in FileDirector. This is a simple process with FileDirector’s integration with Microsoft Office applications and with Windows Explorer. Just choose to send the document to FileDirector and you can then index the document, or have FileDirector take information, such as the file name and date automatically. When saving emails from Outlook, these can be indexed automatically, using the email data such as ‘To, ‘From’, Subject’ and even the email body.</p>
    <br>
    <p>FileDirector can also automatically import documents from specified locations, so all the files held there can be imported at one time. This can be server-based, or user controlled.</p>

    <h4>Paper Documents:</h4>
    <p> FileDirector has capture capabilities included within the standard Client software, so there is no need to run one application for capturing and another for retrieving. Also, Scan Profiles can be created which hold the settings for the capture device, and can also be configured to store documents under specific categories. FileDirector supports thousands of input devices, with its support for ISIS, TWAIN and its integration with eCopy ShareScan, enabling you to send documents from your MFP directly to FileDirector.</p>
