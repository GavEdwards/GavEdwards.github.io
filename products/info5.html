                WebClient – World-Wide included WebClient allows you to use practically all the advantages of fileDirector — wherever you happen to be. Using a web browser, you can access documents and thus, for example, take part in approval processes. </p><br>
            <p>A unique feature is that you can even send locally-scanned documents to fileDirector installed back at base — so the documents can be processed on there. </p>
