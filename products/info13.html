    <h4>Complete Document Management Solution</h4>
    <p>FileDirector records electronic documents as flexibly and quickly as paper documents. The particular format and source are not an issue. No matter what applications your business uses, with the help of our tools, you can very quickly create interfaces to FileDirector. FileDirector integrates out of the box with Microsoft Office and Windows Explorer, meaning that electronic documents can be sent and catalogued there via mouseclick. Information such as filenames and date are recorded by the software, along with the sender or subject-line of e-mails. </p>
    <br>
    <p>FileDirector offers the same powerful functions for paper documents too: one and the same application allows the user to record documents and search them in an already-digitised format. This means that user work at all times with a familiar user interface, regardless of whether they are searching or capturing documents originally in digital or non-digital format — something that is a huge benefit in ease of use.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Importing Documents and Data</h4>
    <p>FileDirector imports practically any imaginable data, working in conjunction with Windows clients and servers. Using individual specifications, documents can be imported from any data source from the client machine. </p>
    <br>
    <p>FileDirector can also automatically import documents from specified locations, so all the files held there can be imported at one time. This can be server based, or user controlled.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Automatic Sorting of Documents</h4>
    <p> Whether delivery notes, invoices or credit notes — FreeForm automatically recognises documents and even checks invoice numbers or possible VAT discrepancies. This means that even large volumes of documents such as invoices can be indexed with ease.</p>
