            <h4>Secure Your Documents and Data</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Any enterprise needs to protect documents against unauthorised access, copying, changes and deletions. FileDirector ensures comprehensive security for the documents it handles. To that end, the software makes use of a range of different mechanisms, working together across a number of levels. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The basic principle for all protection techniques is rights administration based on user and groups. To avoid unnecessary effort, FileDirector takes all the necessary information from Active Directory. The administrator then defines access to filing cabinets, document types, documents and functions. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All activities within FileDirector can be recorded to provide a full history. In addition, the history for each document is recorded and can be viewed.

                <h4>Permissions:</h4>
                <br>
                <p> Actual access to the documents handled in FileDirector is protected via a whole raft of proven and standardised encryption techniques. These include SSl encoding, for instance, with up to 168 bit codes, along with the use of digital signatures and certificates. The security concept is rounded out through intermeshing the Windows operating system and FileDirector: Windows handles authentication, and FileDirector decides which documents the user is allowed to access. </p>
