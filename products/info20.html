                <p>Fix certain FileDirector privelidges to chosen accounts. If you want to make sure one person always has access to certain actions with documents in FileDirector you can use a named user licence. You can purchase as many of these as you need and it is joined to the licenced account. These can be paired with concurrent licences for flexibility in the workforce and ensuring that your FileDirector document management system is efficient and easy.</p><br>
