    <h4>Integration With Your Daily Documents</h4>

        <p>Stand-alone solutions don’t bring about increases in productivity. That’s why FileDirector integrates with outstanding ease into your existing applications landscape. No matter what the applications you use — we are sure to have the right link for those applications. Whether that requires a standardised link, a link via the WebServer integrated in FileDirector, or an interface to your SAP system.</p>

    <h4>Microsoft Office</h4>
    <p>FileDirector integrates seamlessly into Microsoft office products such as Word, Excel or outlook. At the same time, the software also integrates with Windows Explorer, so that all commonly used Windows functions can interact with FileDirector.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Email Capture</h4>
    <p>FileDirectors MailStore module can automatically process e-mails sent and received from an e-mail server via SMTP. E-mails can be sorted and indexed in many ways such as subject line, recipient or sender. Wide-ranging criteria can be specified for each of the categories such as name and address of sender.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Virtual Network Printers</h4>
    <p> FileDirector offers a virtual network printer (VNP), which converts printed data into image files and then saves them to a predefined directory. The data can be imported and archived from this directory using a schedule based FileDirector service running in the background. As an example, accounting software can automatically send the print data at the same time as the normal print request to the VNP, without the user needing to arrange extra settings or even initiate a duplicate print request.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Web Integration:</h4>
    <p>The WebServer is a constituent part of FileDirector that you integrate into your intranet or into the company’s website. It allows any internet user, or particular customers, to have access to the respective documents. Naturally, the security settings for document access can be adapted to suit your own requirements.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>SAP Integration:</h4>
    <p>SAP integration means that documents can be called up and stored directly from the SAP application. FileDirector connector is a full document recording and search application for use with the SAP archiveLink interface.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Codeless connector:</h4>
    <p>Link applications already used in your business to FileDirector WinClient, with absolutely no programming needed. The only requirement is for a link, which can be quickly created, between the application index fields and FileDirector. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>FileDirector Link:</h4>
    <p>Links can be used to call up documents in FileDirector from a company-internal application. In addition commands can be sent to WinClient to display existing documents or scan new documents. Specifically defined URL like commands contain the precise index data for a search or operation.</p>
