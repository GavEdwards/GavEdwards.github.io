                <p>FileDirector supports the checking of documents in and out for making edits. This allows only one person to work on a document at a time, preventing other members from overwriting each other’s changes and ensuring document integrity is maintained.</p><br><p>
When a change is made and a document is checked back in to FileDirector it is stored as a revision and logged in the revision history along with information such as the date, time and user who made the change. This creates traceability in every action, important for data security and creating evidence in case of malicious activity.</p>

                <p>Naturally, FileDirector also keeps a log of all activities. Administrators can call up the history at any time to inspect any document activity</p>
